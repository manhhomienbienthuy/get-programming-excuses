The problem seems to be with our legacy software
Nobody has ever complained about it
Well at least we know not to try that again
It's just some unlucky coincidence
That's interesting, how did you manage to make it do that?
That worked perfectly when I developed it
It's a known bug with the server software
It's a remote vendor issue
I was just fixing that
I did a quick fix last time but it broke when we rebooted
I can't test everything
Well, that's a first
Somebody must have changed my code
The third party documentation doesn't exist
The unit test doesn't cover that eventuality
It works for me
The specifications were ambiguous
You're doing it wrong
Our internet connection must not be working
I must have been stress testing our production server
That's the fault of the graphic designer
The project manager said no one would want that feature
It's always been like that
I can't make that a priority right now
THIS can't be the source of THAT
It worked yesterday
I'm not familiar with it so I didn't fix it in case I made it worse
I haven't had any experience with that before
I didn't receive a ticket for it
Our redundant systems must have failed as well
I haven't touched that code in weeks
Oh, that was only supposed to be a placeholder
How is that possible?
What did you type in wrong to get it to crash?
I'm not getting any error codes
