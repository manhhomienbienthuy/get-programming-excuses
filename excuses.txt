The problem seems to be with our legacy software
Nobody has ever complained about it
Well at least we know not to try that again
It's just some unlucky coincidence
That's interesting, how did you manage to make it do that?
That worked perfectly when I developed it
It's a known bug with the server software
It's a remote vendor issue
I was just fixing that
I did a quick fix last time but it broke when we rebooted
I can't test everything
Well, that's a first
Somebody must have changed my code
The third party documentation doesn't exist
The unit test doesn't cover that eventuality
It works for me
The specifications were ambiguous
You're doing it wrong
Our internet connection must not be working
I must have been stress testing our production server
That's the fault of the graphic designer
The project manager said no one would want that feature
It's always been like that
I can't make that a priority right now
THIS can't be the source of THAT
It worked yesterday
I'm not familiar with it so I didn't fix it in case I made it worse
I haven't had any experience with that before
I didn't receive a ticket for it
Our redundant systems must have failed as well
I haven't touched that code in weeks
Oh, that was only supposed to be a placeholder
How is that possible?
What did you type in wrong to get it to crash?
I'm not getting any error codes
Management insisted we wouldn't need to waste our time writing unit tests
I couldn't find any examples of how that can be done anywhere online
It's a known bug with the programming language
The accounting department must have cancelled that subscription
The program has never collected that information
It must be a firewall issue
You must be missing some of the dependencies
You must have done something wrong
Did you check for a virus on your system?
I haven't been able to reproduce that
Where were you when the program blew up?
It would take too long to rewrite the code from scratch
Our code quality is no worse than anyone else in the industry
I thought I finished that
It's not a code problem - our users need more training
It must be because of a leap second
I heard there was a solar flare today
Why do you want to do it that way?
Oh, that was just a temporary fix
You must have the wrong version
It's a browser compatibility issue
It must be because of a leap year
I'm surprised that was working at all
I can have a look but there's a lot of if statements in that code!
That code seemed so simple I didn't think it needed testing
No one told me so I was forced to assume which way to do that
That was literally a one in a million error
The third party API is not responding
