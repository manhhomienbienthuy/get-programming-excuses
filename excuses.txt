The problem seems to be with our legacy software
Nobody has ever complained about it
Well at least we know not to try that again
It's just some unlucky coincidence
That's interesting, how did you manage to make it do that?
That worked perfectly when I developed it
It's a known bug with the server software
It's a remote vendor issue
I was just fixing that
I did a quick fix last time but it broke when we rebooted
I can't test everything
Well, that's a first
Somebody must have changed my code
The third party documentation doesn't exist
The unit test doesn't cover that eventuality
It works for me
The specifications were ambiguous
